                        <p>The plot of the first novel begins in the summer of 1991. Shortly before his eleventh
                            birthday, Harry receives a letter inviting him to introduce himself at the beginning of the
                            school year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft. Despite attempts by his uncle and aunt to
                            prevent him from going there, Rubeus Hagrid, a "half-giant" sent by Hogwarts director Albus
                            Dumbledore, will introduce Harry to the wizarding world and bring him to King's Cross
                            Station in London, where he will take the Hogwarts Express to his new school.
                        </p>
                        <p>Once at Hogwarts, Harry learns to master and use the magical powers he possesses and makes
                            two inseparable friends: Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. The trio tries to prevent
                            Voldemort from seizing Nicolas Flamel's Philosopher's Stone, kept under guard at Hogwarts.

                        <p>The next year, Harry and his friends face a new threat at Hogwarts. The famous Chamber
                            of Secrets, built several centuries earlier by one of the school's founders, Salazar
                            Slytherin, was reopened by his "heir". This House, according to legend, would contain a
                            gigantic monster intended to kill muggle children accepted at school against Slytherin's
                            wish. Hermione, born to muggle parents, is also threatened.

                        <p> Harry, knowing how to speak parseltongue, is accused first
                            Instead of being the heir to Slytherin by most students, while Ginny Weasley, Ron's sister,
                            is curiously manipulated by a diary that belonged to a certain Tom Riddle. Harry later
                            learns that Riddle and Voldemort are one and the same person, and that Riddle is
                            Slytherin's true heir, acting on the school through his memories in his diary.

                        <p>In the summer of 1993, wizards, as well as Muggles, were informed of the prison escape of a
                            dangerous criminal named Sirius Black. A little later, Harry learns that Black's motivation
                            is to kill him in order to allow Voldemort, his master, to recover the extent of his power.
                            An important security device is set up at Hogwarts to protect Harry during the year. At the
                            same time, he meets his new professor of defense against the forces of evil, Professor
                            Lupine, an old friend of his parents and from whom he becomes very close. Harry regularly
                            uses his father's invisibility cloak as well as the Marauder's map to explore the
                            little-known corners of the castle and travel to the nearby village of Hogsmeade, despite
                            being forbidden to leave school.
                        </p>
                        <p>At the end of the year, Sirius Black manages to attract Harry, Ron and Hermione outside the
                            school and, in the presence of Lupine who comes to find them, explains the real motivations
                            of his escape: find and kill Peter Pettigrew, a wizard who has been hiding for twelve years
                            under the appearance of Ron's pet rat. According to Black, Pettigrew would be responsible
                            for the treason of James and Lily Potter. Before they died, they had made Sirius Black
                            their wedding witness and the godfather of their son, Harry.

                        <p>In the plot of the fourth novel, an edition of the famous Triwizard tournament is held
                            exceptionally at Hogwarts and two other European delegations go on site to participate in
                            the competition. Harry is forced to participate in the tournament, which takes place in
                            three events over the year. The first is to retrieve a golden egg protected by a dragon,
                            the second to recover a loved one at the bottom of Hogwarts Lake and the last, to progress
                            in an obstacle maze to reach the victory trophy concealed at the inside.

                        <p>While Harry and Cedric grab the trophy at the same time, they are teleported to Peter
                            Pettigrew. After killing Cedric Diggory, Pettigrow uses Harry's blood to revive Voldemort
                            and remove the boy's natural protection from his previous immunity against the dark
                            wizard's powers. Harry confronts Voldemort who has resumed human form, but manages to
                            escape by catching the trophy that brings him back to Hogwarts.

                            teacher, Dolores Umbridge, hired by the Minister of Magic himself, is quick to enact strict
                            school rules, banning students to practice magic, gather in groups or read some newspaper
                            articles defending Harry Potter's point of view on Voldemort's return. At the end of the
                            year, trapped by Voldemort, Harry goes to the Department of Magic where he thinks his
                            godfather is being detained and tortured.

                            cousin and Voldemort's right hand man. Back at Hogwarts, Harry learns that he is the only
                            person to have a chance to defeat Voldemort forever. After the events of the ministry he
                            witnessed, Minister Cornelius Fudge finally admitted the return of Voldemort and the second
                            war officially began.

                        <p>The plot of this sixth novel focuses more on the story of Voldemort. In parallel, during his
                            Potions classes, Harry retrieves an old manual that belonged to a certain "Half-Blood
                            Prince". The book is filled with a multitude of tips and notes added by hand by its former
                            owner, and thanks to which Harry achieves extraordinary results. Knowing that he has been
                            convicted of handling one of the horcruxes, Dumbledore asks the professor to intervene in
                            Draco's place in time, allowing Snape to remain credible in the eyes of Voldemort at the
                            same time. Snape commits his word to Dumbledore, who gives him no choice.

                            leaving Harry, the other students, and all Hogwarts staff to mourn the loss of the greatest
                            wizard of his generation and Voldemort's main obstacle.

                        <p>Harry must die because he himself is an involuntary horcrux since the day Voldemort tried to
                            kill him when he was just a baby. Resigned, Harry goes to Voldemort in the Forbidden
                            Forest. Having used Harry's blood to recreate his body after the Triwizard Tournament,
                            Voldemort would have transferred into himself some of the protective charm that Lily Potter
                            had passed on to his son. Therefore, as long as this spell is present in Voldemort's body,
                            Harry can not die. Neville Longbottom pulls the Gryffindor sword from the Magic Hat and
                            uses it to decapitate the snake.

                        <p>With all horcruxes now destroyed, Voldemort becomes a mere mortal. The meeting of Harry and
                            Voldemort's two spells steals the elder wand from the dark wizard's hands, the wand
                            refusing to kill Harry, his rightful master, and the only one to accept death. Voldemort is
                            killed by his own evil spell.
